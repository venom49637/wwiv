                *** Attention Windows Users ***

    You may need to download the Visual Studio 2017 redistributable
    files. 
    
    Here's the official link: 
    https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746571
    
    If you have trouble with that link, it's also available here:
    https://storage.googleapis.com/build-iv/redist/vc2017/vcredist_x86.exe
    
    If you see errors about missing DLL files, you may need to install this
    package before using WWIV (init.exe, bbs.exe, everything).


WWIV 5.3 Getting Started
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you already have WWIV 4.3 or 5.x installed, just copy the EXE and DLL 
files over your existing 4.3/5.x installation. Please backup your previous
binaries and configuration files.

The command line parameters have changed quite a bit, I suggest running
"bbs -? | more" to see the list of changes.

So far, WWIV 5.3 is still fully compatable with your existing WWIV 4.30
and 5.x installations (Just drop it in and run init to upgrade the 
data files and go).

Run WWIVServer.exe and then select the menu Edit > Preferences and setup
the information for your configuration (paths, and the starting and ending
node numbers to use for inbound telnet). Then choose File > Start Server.
Now the WWIV5Server is listening on a socket and ready to spawn 
instances of WWIV.  You do not need to keep multiple copies of WWIV running
at all times, as the WTS will spawn them as required.

Full documentation is avalable online: http://docs.wwivbbs.org

*** Be sure to read WHATSNEW.TXT for a list of all the new major features and
other changes that have happened since 5.0. ***

NOTE: Serial I/O Support has been removed. Use one of the serial -> telnet
bridges for "Dial Up" support.

DEVELOPMENT INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    WWIV is compiled with the following compilers:
        MS Visual C++ 2017 Community Edition.
        GCC 6.3 on Debian 9 Linux

    I recommend using MSVC 2017 Community Edition on Windows.
    It is available for free.

The following copyright statements and licenses apply to the various open
source softwares components included with WWIV.

for any direct, indirect, incidental, special or consequential damages
arising out of the use of or inability to use this software.

Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
freely, subject to the above disclaimer and the following restrictions:

    1. Redistributions of source code (in whole or in part) must retain
       the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer, and this list
       of conditions.

    2. Redistributions in binary form (compiled executables and libraries)
       must reproduce the above copyright notice, definition, disclaimer,
       and this list of conditions in documentation and/or other materials
       provided with the distribution.  The sole exception to this condition
       is redistribution of a standard UnZipSFX binary (including SFXWiz) as
       part of a self-extracting archive; that is permitted without inclusion
       of this license, as long as the normal SFX banner has not been removed
       from the binary or disabled.

    3. Altered versions--including, but not limited to, ports to new operating
       systems, existing ports with new graphical interfaces, versions with
       modified or added functionality, and dynamic, shared, or static library
       versions not from Info-ZIP--must be plainly marked as such and must not
       be misrepresented as being the original source or, if binaries,
       compiled from the original source.  Such altered versions also must not
       be misrepresented as being Info-ZIP releases--including, but not
       limited to, labeling of the altered versions with the names "Info-ZIP"
       (or any variation thereof, including, but not limited to, different
       capitalizations), "Pocket UnZip," "WiZ" or "MacZip" without the
       explicit permission of Info-ZIP.  Such altered versions are further
       prohibited from misrepresentative use of the Zip-Bugs or Info-ZIP
       e-mail addresses or the Info-ZIP URL(s), such as to imply Info-ZIP
       will provide support for the altered versions.

    4. Info-ZIP retains the right to use the names "Info-ZIP," "Zip," "UnZip,"
       "UnZipSFX," "WiZ," "Pocket UnZip," "Pocket Zip," and "MacZip" for its
       own source and binary releases.

** cryptlib 3.4.2 (http://www.cryptlib.com/security-software/download-form/download-security-toolkit)

cryptlib is distributed under a dual license that allows free, open-source use
under a GPL-compatible license and closed-source use under a standard
commercial license.  The GPL-compatible license (a.k.a. the Sleepycat license)
is given below.  Further details on this license are available from the
cryptlib home page.

  Copyright 1992-2010 Peter Gutmann. All rights reserved.

  Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

  1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this
     list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

  2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
     this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
     and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

  3. Redistributions in any form must be accompanied by information on how to
     obtain complete source code for the cryptlib software and any accompanying
     software that uses the cryptlib software.  The source code must either be
     included in the distribution or be available for no more than the cost of
     distribution, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable
     conditions.  For an executable file, complete source code means the source
     code for all modules it contains or uses.  It does not include source code
     for modules or files that typically accompany the major components of the
     operating system on which the executable file runs.  Note that decoupling
     the software from the user, for example by running in a SaaS configuration,
     does not exempt you from these requirements.

  IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
  OF SUCH DAMAGE.

If you're unable to comply with the above license then the following,
alternate usage conditions apply:

  Any large-scale commercial use of cryptlib requires a license.  "Large-scale
  commercial use" means any revenue-generating purpose such as use for
  company-internal purposes, or use of cryptlib in an application or product,
  with a total gross revenue of over US$5,000.  This allows cryptlib to be
  used in freeware and shareware applications, for evaluation and research
  purposes, and for non-revenue-generating or personal use without charge.  In
  addition the author reserves the right to grant free licenses for commercial
  use in special cases (for example where there is a general benefit to the
  public), contact the author for details if you think you qualify.
